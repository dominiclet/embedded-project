# Inventory Management System

## Frontend

The frontend web application is currently hosted at https://fluffy-biscotti-b62ab7.netlify.app/. To use the frontend web page with a running backend server, open the console in the browser developer tools and type the following command:

```
document.BASE_URL = "<BACKEND_BASE_URL>";
```

where <BACKEND_BASE_URL> is the URL of the backend server. Ensure that the backend server is accessible by your computer.

If you would like to run the development frontend server instead, `cd` into the `frontend` directory and run:

```
npm run dev
```
